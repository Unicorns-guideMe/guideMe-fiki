        headline: Personal experience
        body: During our undergraduate years, we noticed that almost everytime we study for an exam or do our assignments, we end-up with 20+ opened browser tabs, not remembering where we had seen a piece of information we had to read again and searching through our browsing history for that one essential webpage we had found after one hour of researching, but closed it by mistake. These obstacles are time-consumming and distract us while trying to learn something, therefore we considered that there is room for improvement.

        headline: Validation from others
        body: We got the confirmation that others have the same issues from casual conversations with our friends and classmates.

    title: What we believe could be the solution
    text: Our idea is to develop a learning assistant that helps the user in the process of finding the right resources, saving and organizing them as well. The project comes as a browser plugin, that shows users recommended resources when they search for a certain topic and allows them to save web pages and keep notes in a journal. In addition, the user can rate the quality of the content, and mark the understanding level needed in order to be able to gain knowledge from it (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert).

    text: For the problem validation we thought a bigger group of people will offer better insights, which is why we created a Google Form. To make sure the form yields as much information as possible we went back and modified the questions after receiving feedback, after that we distributed it on social media and to friends and family. <br> For the solution validation we wanted to get closer to our potential customers, so we decided to conduct some interviews with people who had as little knowledge as possible about our idea. We took this approach because interviews allow us to come with questions on the spot, to understand better what would work and what would not work, but also what we have to focus on for the first iteration of the product.

    text1: In order to validate our problem we asked people to answer a questionaire about their learning habits and needs. We also asked some demographic related questions to gauge who our target user group would be. Aside from multiple or single choice answers we also asked open ended questions for which the results are summarized below.
    open:
        - question: About what domains have you studied in the past 6 months?
          answer: The most popular answers were related to computer science and engineering (43 answers in total), which mostly referred to programming (8 answers), IT (7 answers), and AI (6 answers). These were followed by personal development related answers (15 in total), and art related answers (9 answers total).
        - question: Do you organize the information you find in any way? If yes, how?
          answer: Almost half of the participants (28 out of 60 at that moment) do not take notes as they learn. Regarding the other half, we observed a few general trends. 7 of them prefer to separate their materials into categories, 6 of them use diagrams and other ways of compressing the information, 6 of them take physical notes, 5 of them use tools to take notes (such as one note, google docs, etc), 5 of them sort the materials by difficulty and 3 of them could not be put into a category. It is important to note that these categories can overlap. For example someone who sorts the materials by difficulty could also be using an online tool for learning, but this aspect was not specified when completing the questionaire.
        - question: What are the steps you follow when learning something new?
          answer: "Here we observed the following trends: some of them start from general knowledge about the subject and then go on to particular information, some of them first look at the theory and then explore practical aspects such as exercises or hands on labs, some of them use mostly online resources, some of them read the materials they find repeatedly until they memorize."
