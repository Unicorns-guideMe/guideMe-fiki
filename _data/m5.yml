  title: Advertising channels comparison
  facebook:
    desc: We posted on Facebook twice. Although the posts didn't get many likes, HotJar recordings showed about 20 users came from Facebook. After looking at the recordings from HotJar we approximate that about <strong>5</strong> people coming from Facebook subscribed to the newsletter. Also, looking at the data gathered by Google Analytics, the second post drove the most views from Facebook. The reason is most likely the fact that the first post was sent late in the night while the second was sent in the evening, when people are more likely to browse Facebook.
    yield: low
  whatsapp:
    desc: We sent messages to groups and friends asking them to check out our landing page and to subscribe to the newsletter if they saw value in our idea. We approximate that <strong>10</strong> emails came from WhatsApp, judging by the timestamps of when we received the emails and when we posted the messages. This channel was great because we also got to answer questions and receive valuable feedback.
    yield: moderate
  linkedin:
    desc: The 2 LinkedIn posts gained <strong>400+ views</strong>. LinkedIn yielded most of the views to the landing page and most of the emails, about <strong>15</strong>. This channel gave us some insights on who saw our posts (studies, employer, position). Most of the people who saw our posts are software developers or computer science students. We managed to reach people from 10 different companies with roles ranging from junior developers to executives.
    yield: good
