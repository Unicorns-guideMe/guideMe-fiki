    desc1: "Our target market is divided into two main sets: <b> students </b> and <b> working professionals </b> that want to expand their knowledge."
    desc2: "We expect the majority of our clients to be students, because they have the greatest need for taking notes. We will focus on this segment at first because it is easier to get an estimate on the size of the market."
    desc3: "A statistic from the Romania Nationat Statistics Institute shows that for the school year of 2019-2020 there are roughly <b> 400.000 students </b>.
    In the beginning we expect to have a presence only in the Romanian market, because it will be easier for us to advertise. But as our bussines 
    grows we can very easily expand our product to an international audience. A statistc from the eurostat website, says that in 2018 there were <b> 17.5 million students in the EU </b>."

    explanation: We can compute that an estimate market total is equal to almost 14.6 mil users. However, we are not able to find out exactly how these statistics are gathered by the product owners and if they have duplicates or not. In addition, our solution is not meant to replace a note-taking app, it is more of a complementary resource used for obtaining better learning resources, which does not have a concrete market of its own. Also, we have an untapped potential among students, with 17.5 million just in the European Union alone which we could attract, but for which we could not compute a specific part without knowing the percentage of students who use one of the above-presented apps. With these being said, we will continue presenting our estimations.
    estimation: In the first week of promoting our product, we gained 28 subscribers. If we keep gaining a constant number of subscribers every week, we will eventually have 1500 users in the first year. After growing our userbase, we expect a higher increase in the usage of the product. We aim for an exponential increase in our user gain each year.

    note: Although a market share of 0.41% seems like a quite small precentage, taking into consideration that the market is quite large, having 14.6 mil users, with competitors with big ecosystems like Microsoft and Google, this is actually a pretty good result.
