        desc: "How much time do you spend while searching through web pages, articles, or watching videos on the Internet while trying to find out more about a new topic or while making research? Have you ever questioned the trustworthiness of the given information? How about its relevance or quality? All of us have stumbled upon this problem while trying to gain knowledge about a certain subject we have just decided to learn more about. Besides the fact that grasping some complex concepts can be really hard, trying to achieve this using poor made resources really adds significant difficulty to it."

      - title: "Solution"
        desc: "The guideMe Project tries to make learning and researching on the Internet easier, by creating an assistant that recommends relevant resources to its users. These resources include articles, videos, blogs, and even courses from different platforms that are curated by other more experienced users by grading them based on their experience and how it affected their learning process. We believe that this project will promote self-learning and contribute to raising the quality of Internet content for learning."

    title: Customer segments
    text1: On one hand, our product serves anyone who wants to learn something new and has access to the internet. Although we expect people of all ages to use our product, a statistic from 2016 from the statistical office of the European Union shows that the participation of younger individuals (aged 25–34) in non formal learning activities in the EU was more than 20 percentage points higher than that of older ones (aged 55–64).
    text2: On the other hand, we can also make partnerships with universities and companies, offering them a better deal for a large group of students/employees.
