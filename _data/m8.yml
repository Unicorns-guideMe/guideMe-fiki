  subtitle: Feedback from users
  desc: We shared our solution through social media and direct messages to make it visible to the public.
   After testing it, some users gave us feedback and told us an opinion about their experience. 
    Thus, we found out what are the strengths and weaknesses of our solution and what improvements we can make. 
    Currently, none of the users we spoke to is willing to give money to use our app in its current state. 
    This drives us to further improve our application for an even more enjoyable user experience.
  conclusions:
    This stage of development helped us understand that our application is actually useful for our targeted users and it would be used as a free app for now. 
    The strong point of the app is the note taking feature with the possibility to add multiple tags and sort the materials by them. 
    The users find it a better way to organize their resources than the standard bookmarking feature of a browser. 
    As a future step, a significant improvement for our application would be to create a tutorial to explain the flow of the extension so it is more clear to users.
